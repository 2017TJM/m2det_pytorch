# m2det_pytorch
re-implementation M2Det in pytorch based on official M2Det codes [here](https://github.com/qijiezhao/M2Det)

## features
+ pretrained vgg16 model weight from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/vgg16_reducedfc.pth)
+ support single-GPU/multi-GPU training/test
+ compatiable to mmdetection framework, modules can be integrate to mmdetection lib.
but for some reason, the interface was little different, if you want exactly same interface module,
you can check [here](https://)
